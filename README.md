# Purpose 
The purpose of this project was to try out Latex while building a simple CV template.

# Content
The project is based on the following three files:
* **cvlayout.cls**
  - Contains everything related to the graphical design of the CV.
* **cvcontent.sty**
  - Contains everything related to the professional experiences.
* **cv.tex**
  - This is where things from both files above are mixed to create the final CV.
